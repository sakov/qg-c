    -- Introduced parameters "dtoutave" and "outfnameave" to output model
       time average dumps. Activated when defined "dtoutave". Similarly to
       "dtout", "dtoutave" must contain integer number of model timne steps.
       The average is calculated by the trapezoid rule (weights 1/2, 1, 1, ...,
       1/2).
    -- Placed "qgprm" into "model"; removed fields in "model" duplicated in
       "qgprm".
