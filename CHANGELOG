    -- Fixed a few defects manifested after setting dtout to NaN.

    PS 21062024
    -- Fixed some defects manifested whith undefined dtobs.
    -- Made it possible to set dtout to NaN provided that either of dtoutave or
       dtobs is defined.

    PS 19062024
    -- Added generation of obs. The observation cell indices are uniformly
       distributed in the interval [0, nx * ny - 1], with the position of the
       first observation randomly chosen in this interval. In practice for
       given settings the clustering of observations may differ from a few
       tracks to an about uniform grid, depending on the specified number of
       observations. The observation positions and errors are designed to
       reproduce for repeated runs. For now, observations are for "psi" only.
v0.14
    PS 16062024
    -- Introduced parameters "dtoutave" and "outfnameave" to output model
       time average dumps. Activated when defined "dtoutave". Similarly to
       "dtout", "dtoutave" must contain integer number of model timne steps.
       The average is calculated by the trapezoid rule (weights 1/2, 1, 1, ...,
       1/2).
    -- Placed "qgprm" into "model"; removed fields in "model" duplicated in
       "qgprm".
